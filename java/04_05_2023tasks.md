EXERCISES RELATED TO OBJECT:

1.create a class named Food with some variables and methods and then  create a object in same class, try to access these methods and variables

2.create a class called Pizza and create a object for food class and try to acces the variables and methods in it. 

3.Write a program to print the area of a rectangle by creating a class named 'Area' having two methods. First method named as 'setDim' takes length and breadth of rectangle as parameters and the second method named as 'getArea' returns the area of the rectangle. Length and breadth of rectangle are entered through keyboard.

4.Write a program to print the area of a rectangle by creating a class named 'Area' taking the values of its length and breadth as parameters of its constructor and having a method named 'returnArea' which returns the area of the rectangle. Length and breadth of rectangle are entered through keyboard.

Create a class named 'Shape' with a method to print "This is This is shape". Then create two other classes named 'Rectangle', 'Circle' inheriting the Shape class, both having a method to print "This is rectangular shape" and "This is circular shape" respectively. Create a subclass 'Square' of 'Rectangle' having a method to print "Square is a rectangle". Now call the method of 'Shape' and 'Rectangle' class by the object of 'Square' class.

All the banks operating in India are controlled by RBI. RBI has set a well defined guideline (e.g. minimum interest rate, minimum balance allowed, maximum withdrawal limit etc) which all banks must follow. For example, suppose RBI has set minimum interest rate applicable to a saving bank account to be 4% annually; however, banks are free to use 4% interest rate or to set any rates above it.
Write a JAVA program to implement bank functionality in the above scenario and demonstrate the dynamic polymorphism concept. Note: Create few classes namely Customer, Account, RBI (Base Class) and few derived classes (SBI, ICICI, PNB etc). Assume and implement required member variables and functions in each class.

Hint:
Class Customer

{

//Personal Details ...

// Few functions ...

}

Class Account

{

// Account Detail ...

// Few functions ...

}

Class RBI

{

Customer c; //hasA relationship

Account a; //hasA relationship

..
Public double GetInterestRate() { }

Public double GetWithdrawalLimit() { }

}

Class SBI: public RBI

{

//Use RBI functionality or define own functionality.

}

Class ICICI: public RBI

{

//Use RBI functionality or define own functionality.

}
